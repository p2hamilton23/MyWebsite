</p> My hero is Randy Moss. He was a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings, San Francisco 49ers, Tennessee Titans, New England Patriots, and the Las Vegas Raiders in the National Football League. He was drafted in the 1998 NFL draft with the 21st pick in the first round by the Minnesota Vikings. In college he played for Marshall University and Florida State. Standing at 6 foot 4 inches Randy Moss was known for his quickness, height, catching ability, and jumping ability. He is considered one the best football players of all time and is arguably  the greatest wide receiver of all time. But in my opinion he is indeed the greatest receiver of all time. He revolutionized the way that the current day receiver plays the game.

</p> He is my hero due to the amount of confidence and how he held himself. Randy Moss never would not hold himself accountable and he was never beating himself up. An important attribute in a human is to have self confidence and he had more than enough of it. I also look up to him through his ideologies and how he would never sell himself short taking advantage of every situation to the fullest. He would always outwork everyone around him and made everyone around him better at the same time. Overall that is why Randy Moss is my hero.
